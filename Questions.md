1. The ticket forwarding sent every time a ticket is issued or only when stop.

I think that in GSM /GPRS its sent every time a ticket is issued.

My guess would be every time a ticket is issued.

300 buses in Madurai => Scalable or not? One bus every few seconds I'm sending a couple of kbs of data - all over tn - server will be receiving simultaneous load requests....

Similarly, Server load problem?

Or Network bandwith - traffic  problem? I don't think so.. what's your take?
