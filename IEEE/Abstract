## Motivation: and ##What problem are you trying to solve? What is the scope of your work 
(a generalized approach, or for a specific situation)? Be careful not to use too much jargon

Why do we care about the problem and the results?

Public transport plays a major (key) role in transporting the civilian population around the city/town & is essential in 
meeting the transportation needs of the people in the cities/towns.

Using public transport helps reduce traffic congestion & 

Some of the major obstacles/challenges preventing passengers from choosing public transport are :

i. Overcrowding of buses

In India, most (statistc %) occur due to footboarding where the root problem is overcrowding. 
Female & senior passengers find it difficult to travel in such conditions.



ii. Waiting for buses & uncertainty in arrival time of buses.

Passengers spend 1/3 of their commute time searching & waiting for the right bus. Lack of proper information among passenger community. 
So far only by word of mouth.

Approach:
How did you go about solving or making progress on the problem? 
## In countries like India, these problems are even more pronounced (serious) . And  There are unique challenges to be addressed.
 My approach:
 
 Our paper proposes a unique solution that applies for Indian subcontinent and countries with a similar structure.
Unique challenge is that buses in India are extra overcrowded. So alternate solutions for 
crowd based route recommendation - like camera, IR lasers at entrances (2), otehr sensors are not suitable for our country.
So make use of the existence of the conductor & ETM ... :
 
 Overcrowding: == ETM based on the tickets sold. Here ETM is the 'thing' equipped with GPS & transmits via GSM/GPRS.
 
 Uncertainty - provide a schedule in the form of an app 
 
 Enable real time location information/ tracking of the bus via the app.

What was the extent of your work (did you look at one application program or a hundred programs in twenty different programming languages?)

Scope/ Extent of my work is for

i. TNSTC (soon to be activated ETMS)
ii. Android phones

Results:
What's the answer?

The uncertainty in arrival of the bus can be tackled by the GPS based tracking of the ETM - so that problem is solved.

The overcrowding issue can be solved based on the server side api which the ETM communicates with .

Conclusions:
What are the implications of your answer

More useful information is provided to the passenger.

Enabling my target audience (women, senior passengers, foreigners) to make more informed decisions. 

Empowering them with information to take informed decisions! 

Less over crowding -> Less accidents

Better services -> Makes Public transport more friendly to passengers & reduces traffic congestion.
