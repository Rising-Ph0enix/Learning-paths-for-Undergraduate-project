Public transport plays a crucial role in meeting a city’s transportation needs. Moreover, it helps reduce traffic congestion and vehicular pollution. In India, buses are the preferred mode of transit due to their cheap fare and extensive routes. The major obstacles to their usage are: 1) overcrowding and 2) uncertainty in arrival time. Crowd estimation techniques using cameras, infrared lasers at entrances are not suitable for Indian metros. Hence, our paper proposes a solution leveraging the Internet of Things. We have simulated the handheld Electronic Ticketing Machines (ETMS) used by TNSTC (Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation) conductors via an android application. Crowd estimation is done by maintaining a list of “live” tickets (passenger is on board currently) of each bus at the server side which the ETMs communicate with through an API. The uncertainty in arrival of the bus is overcome by real time tracking using the GPS built into the ETM. The crowd information and location are displayed via a client side android application embedded with Google Maps. This solution empowers passengers to take better decisions by bridging the information gap.
